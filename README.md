# Message Encode Decode in Python with Tkinter
**Python Message Encode-Decode-**  Secure your Information by Encoding the messages

> The objective of this project is to encode and ecode messages using a common key.

Encoding is the process that transforms the text or information to the unrecognizable form and decryption is the process to convert the encrypted message into original form.

#### Message Encode-Decode

Message encoding and decoding is the process to first convert the original text to the random and meaningless text called ciphertext. This process is called encoding. Decoding is the process to convert that ciphertext to the original text. This process is also called the Encryption-Decryption process.

### Prerequisites

#### Tkinter
Standoard GUI python library.

#### base64 
Module that provides a function to encode the binary data to ASCII character and decode that ASCII characters back to binary data.


> You must have python3 installed on your computer to run it.

#### To run the .py file:
Run the below command in terminal or cmd through any IDE you prefer

` $ python encode_decode.py `

or 

` $ python3 endcode_decode.py `
